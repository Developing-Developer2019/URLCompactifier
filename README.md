# URLCompactifier

This is my version of a URL Shortener like bitly

It uses an MVC web app to interact and store the details and an API to fetch the requested details

Before this I only knew how to use an in house SQLHelper with work, and hadn't really touched API. 1 1/2 days of learning gave me this. It started off bumpy with unnecessary data, which I filtered out towards the end with a clean up

It uses SqLite which is a NoSQL server approach with Dapper.
